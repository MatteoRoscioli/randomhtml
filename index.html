            <h2>some stupid stuff that happened to me</h2>
            <p>when i was 3 years old i was almost electrocuted by an outlet. i wanted to see exactly what would happen if i stuck my finger in the slot. i got a tiny shock, enough to make me not want to do that again, but i didnt get hurt thankfully. another time i was playing in minecraft when i found a huge sinkhole. i peered over the edge and accidentally pressed "W" to go forward, and i fell down the sinkhole. as i sat there, feeling stupid, i saw my brother marco fall down the hole too. it was kinda funny but also really stupid.</p>
